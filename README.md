# GynxMusicStudio
Hi, This code is for Gynx Music Studio.
Here I've made it using MVC architecture along with Passport Authentication clubbed along two stratergies Local and Google OAuth2.0.
Most of the data is stored within the files itself such as images, songs(used only one each for different sections to save memory) within the assets folder. 
Tech Stack: HTML,CSS,JS,BootStrap,NodeJs,ejs,MongoDB Atlas,noty Ref: Font Awesome for icons

Steps before running the code do a "npm i" in your terminal to download all the dependencies add 
your google client credentials to the google authenticate file in the config folder,
to enable the google sign-in functions. if you want you can change your secret key for the cookie-sessions as well as
for passport local authentication. I have commented out my mongoDb connection, hence you can use any type of db and get started.

Thank you!!
